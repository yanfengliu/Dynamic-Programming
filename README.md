# Dynamic-Programming

This repo contains python code examples of using dynamic programming technique to solve complicated optimziation problems. Dynamic programming is a useful programming technique that reuses previous calculation results for smaller subproblems in order to solve bigger problems. To use dynamic programming technique, a problem has to have optimal-substructure property. 

This repo currently contains the following examples:
* Fibonacci sequence
* Chance of winning streak given win rate
